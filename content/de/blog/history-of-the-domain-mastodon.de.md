<h><center>The Incredible Story of mastodon.de</center></h>





# Prologue

There are multiple perspectives to this story, and it is hard to come up with the right way of telling it. There is the historic perspective explaining why this domain exists, what it was originally meant for, and why it remained unused up until I got it - and then there's that: WHY did I get it? How did I, Erik Uden, of all people, get involved in this story? mastodon.us is currently being sold for 100k USD on the domain aftermarket, every mastodon.tld has been registered years ago and they're widely sought after! So why would mastodon.de, the **name of the most popular Fediverse software** with the **top level domain of the country it was invented in** (*Germany by the Mastodon gGmbH*) be registered by me, almost two decades after it was initially created.

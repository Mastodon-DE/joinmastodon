# Prologue

There are multiple perspectives to this story, and it is hard to come up with the right way of telling it. There is the historic perspective explaining why this domain exists, what it was originally meant for, and why it remained unused up until I got it - and then there's that: WHY did I get it? How did I, [Erik Uden](https://mastodon.de/@ErikUden), of all people, get involved in this story? mastodon.shop has been sold for 36k USD on the domain aftermarket, every mastodon.tld has been registered years ago and they're widely sought after! So why would mastodon.de, the **name of the most popular Fediverse software** with the **top level domain of the country it was invented in** (*Germany - Mastodon GmbH*) be registered by me, almost two decades after it was initially created. 

This story will focus on the registration of the domain itself, as it required a multi-month operation during the beginning of 2023 (*January to March*) having at some point dozens of people across all timezones working on it for everything to go just ***right***.

# The Beginning - 44,500 years ago

During the *Last Glacial Period*, also known as the ***Ice Age***, around what archeologists estimate to have happened [~44,500 years ago](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/planung-und-durchfuehrung-von-ausstellungen?showall=&start=2), roughly during the *Upper Paleolithic era* of human history, **a ~100 years old, 5 tons heavy mammoth named Oscar roamed the land** of a region that would later be defined as central Europe. This would be the day that Oscar dies. The exact conditions of how this monolith of a mammoth, which is among the [**largest and oldest mammoths that ever walked the earth**](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/mammut-oscar-bestimmt-einen-lebensweg), passed away, are unclear but there are reasons to believe Oscar may have fought with a mountain lion which lead to his death.

Frozen cold under layers of snow and ice, over the course of Millenia, above Oscar's gravesite, there were fought countless wars, cultures emancipated and exterminated, societies rose from ashes and fell from grace; **Oscar existed before the Germanic people**, **before even the remote concept of a "European" continent** and will still be there when those perish. Yet, surprisingly, long after his death, Oscar was first seen again in Siegsdorf (*Chiemgau*), a southern German village in Bavaria, central Europe, on an eventful [Saturday in October 1975](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/ein-junge-verwirklicht-einen-traum). A 16 year old German boy, out to find rare metals, through pure chance discovered and later named Oscar. That boy's name was **Bernard Raymond von Bredow** who will become the **center piece of this story**. 

As uncoordinated as it can get, young Bernard excavated most of Oscar's bones over the course of the following three weeks from the clay he found them in, and then [stored them in his mother's attic without telling a soul](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/). However, the following Winter in 1975 would distract young Bernard from his shared path with Oscar the Mammoth for over a decade, as his family inherited a farm in New Zealand, to which Bernard moved in an act of self-discovery to become:

- substitute laborer
- piano tuner
- rock musician
- problem analyst

This must've been among the most exciting times in Bernard's life, *so far*. As at the end of 1984 he traveled back to his home city in Bavaria, rediscovering his love for archeology. When the winter's snow melted [in early 1985 he began working on his site of discovery yet again](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/). Bernard would begin publicly talking about Oscar the Mammoth, even began getting the authorities and professors involved. Under Bernard Raymond von Bredow's guidance, 22,300mÂ³ of dirt have been moved in order to find more of the mammoth's skeleton. Bernard seemed obsessed with Oscar and finding the rest of his remains, weeks on end he'd reconstruct his skeleton in order to know what bones were missing only to then [tirelessly search after and dig for them, knee-deep in the mud](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/) of the archeologic site (*Gerhartsreiter Graben in Siegsdorf*). The locals initially thought he was insane, out of his mind, but all of that changed when they saw what he dragged out of the site with him: a **cave lion**, **woolly rhinoceros**, and a **Megaloceros** (*giant deer*) to only name the remains of the extinct animals he discovered.

Suddenly, that skepticism turned into excitement and Bernard's findings were praised in the entire city.

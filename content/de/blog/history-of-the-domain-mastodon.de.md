<h><center>The Incredible Story of the Domain mastodon.de</center></h>

# Prologue

There are multiple perspectives to this story, and it is hard to come up with the right way of telling it. There is the historic perspective explaining why this domain exists, what it was originally meant for, and why it remained unused up until I got it - and then there's that: WHY did I get it? How did I, [Erik Uden](https://mastodon.de/@ErikUden), of all people, get involved in this story? mastodon.shop has been sold for 36k USD on the domain aftermarket, every mastodon.tld has been registered years ago and they're widely sought after! So why would mastodon.de, the **name of the most popular Fediverse software** with the **top level domain of the country it was invented in** (*Germany - Mastodon gGmbH*) be registered by me, almost two decades after it was initially created. 

This story will focus on the registration of the domain itself, as it required a multi-month operation during the beginning of 2023 (*January to March*) having at some point dozens of people across all timezones working on it for everything to go just ***right***.

...with all that done, let us commence forth to the *story of mastodon.de*

# The Beginning - 40.000 years ago

During the *Last Glacial Period*, also known as the ***Ice Age***, around what archeologists estimate to have happened ~40.000 years ago, roughly during the *Upper Paleolithic era* of human history, **a mammoth named Oscar roamed the land** of a region that would later be defined as central Europe. This would be the day that Oscar dies. The exact conditions of how this monolith of a mammoth, which is among the [**largest and oldest mammoths that ever walked the earth**](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/mammut-oscar-bestimmt-einen-lebensweg), are unclear but there are reasons to believe Oscar may have fought with a mountain lion which lead to his death.

Frozen cold under layers of snow and ice, over the course of Millenia, above Oscar's grave, there were fought countless wars, cultures emancipated and exterminated, societies rose from ashes and fell from grace; **Oscar existed before the Germanic people**, **before even the remote concept of a "European" continent** and will still be there when those perish. Yet, surprisingly, after his death Oscar was first seen again in Siegsdorf, a southern German village in central Europe, on a [Saturday in October 1975](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/ein-junge-verwirklicht-einen-traum). A 16 year old German boy discovered and named Oscar. That boy's name was **Bernard von Bredow** who will become the **center piece of this story**.

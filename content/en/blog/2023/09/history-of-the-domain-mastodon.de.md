# Prologue

There are multiple perspectives to this story, and it is hard to come up with the right way of telling it. There is the **historic perspective** explaining why this domain exists, what it was originally meant for, and why it remained unused up until I got it - and then there's that: **WHY did I get it**? How did I, [Erik Uden](https://mastodon.de/@ErikUden), of all people, get involved in this story? mastodon.shop, as an example, has been sold for 36k USD on the domain aftermarket, every mastodon.tld has been registered years ago and they're widely sought after! So why would mastodon.de, the **name of the most popular Fediverse software** with the **top level domain of the country it was invented in** (*Germany - Mastodon GmbH*) be registered by me, more than two decades after it was initially created?

This story will focus on the registration of the domain itself, as it required a multi-month operation during the beginning of 2023 (*January to early March*) having at some point dozens of people across all time zones working on it for everything to go just ***right***.

...with all that done, let us commence forth to the *story of mastodon.de*

# The Beginning - 44,500 years ago

During the *Last Glacial Period*, also known as the ***Ice Age***, around what archeologists estimate to have happened [~44,500 years ago](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/planung-und-durchfuehrung-von-ausstellungen?showall=&start=2), roughly during the *Upper Paleolithic era* of human history, **a** [**78 years old**](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/museum-und-steinzeitpark/museumsgeschichte)**, 5 tons heavy mammoth named Oscar roamed the land** of a region that would later be defined as central Europe. This would be the day that Oscar dies. The exact conditions of how this monolith of a mammoth, which is among the [**largest and oldest mammoths that ever walked the earth**](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/mammut-oscar-bestimmt-einen-lebensweg), passed away, are unclear but there are reasons to believe Oscar may have fought with a mountain lion which lead to his death.

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/IMG_11.JPG">

Frozen cold under layers of snow and ice, over the course of Millenia, above Oscar's gravesite, there were fought countless wars, cultures emancipated and exterminated, societies rose from ashes and fell from grace; **Oscar existed before the Germanic people**, **before even the remote concept of a "European" continent** and will still be there when those perish. Yet, surprisingly, long after his death, Oscar was first seen again in Siegsdorf (*Chiemgau*), a southern German village in Bavaria, central Europe, on an eventful [Saturday in October 1975](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/ein-junge-verwirklicht-einen-traum). A 16 year old German boy, out to find rare metals, through pure chance discovered and later named Oscar. That boy's name was **Bernard Raymond von Bredow** who will become the **center piece of this story**.

# Best Friends Forever

As uncoordinated as it can get, young Bernard excavated most of Oscar's bones over the course of the following three weeks from the clay he found them in, and then [stored them in his mother's attic without telling a soul](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/). However, the following Winter in 1975 would distract young Bernard from his shared path with Oscar the Mammoth for over a decade, as his family inherited a farm in New Zealand, to which Bernard moved in an act of self-discovery to become:

- substitute laborer
- piano tuner
- rock musician
- problem analyst

This must've been among the most exciting times in Bernard's life, *so far*. As at the end of 1984 he traveled back to his home city in Bavaria, rediscovering his love for archeology. When the winter's snow melted [in early 1985 he began working on his site of discovery yet again](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/). 

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/IMG_0212.JPG">
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/IMG_0220.JPG">

Bernard would begin publicly talking about Oscar the Mammoth, even began getting the authorities and professors involved. Under Bernard Raymond von Bredow's guidance, **22,300m³ of dirt have been moved in order to find more of the mammoth's skeleton**. Bernard seemed obsessed with Oscar and finding the rest of his remains, weeks on end he'd reconstruct his skeleton in order to know what bones were missing only to then [tirelessly search after and dig for them, knee-deep in the mud](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/) of the archeologic site (*"Gerhartsreiter Graben" in Siegsdorf*). The locals initially thought he was insane, out of his mind, but all of that changed when they saw what he dragged out of the site with him: a **cave lion**, **woolly rhinoceros**, and a **Megaloceros** (*giant deer*) to only name the remains of the extinct animals he discovered. 

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/25.JPG">

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/IMG_0194.JPG">

Suddenly, that skepticism turned into excitement and Bernard's findings were praised in the entire city. This went as far as this city even **changing their Coat of Arms / Emblem to show Oscar the Mammoth**.

Here's a full article Bernard von Bredow wrote about this event himself:

The skeletons, especially Oscar, would continue to be shown at various exhibits all across the world! From Shropshire (*England*), Amsterdam (*Netherlands*), Tyrole (*Austria*), Stockholm (*Sweden*), Halle (*Germany*), [and many many more](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/planung-und-durchfuehrung-von-ausstellungen?showall=&start=1), Oscar has really seen the world, and his companion Bernard Raymond von Bredow alongside with it. In Shropshire he even got to work as a visiting scientist for the University College of Cambridge, later the King of the Netherlands even [talked with Bernard about his skeletons](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/planung-und-durchfuehrung-von-ausstellungen?showall=&start=2) on his own exhibition showcasing an entire family of mammoths that he found.

Yes, you read that right *mammoths*, plural! The initial findings and this acknowledgement sparked something with such an intensity within Bernard, he would dedicate the rest of his life to archeology leading him to discover many, many more mammoths throughout his life - as a matter of fact, counting only the ones from 1985 to 1999, Bernard Raymond von Bredow would organize ten (10) archeologic excavations in Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, England, Siberia (Russia), Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Arizona (USA), Alaska (USA), and Hungary in just those 14 years! He especially enjoyed his time in Siberia and the intensive exchange with the Academy of Science in Moscow in 1991. That same year Bernard would even [supervision Russian scientists](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/expeditionen-und-ausgrabungen) in his own newly founded museum about mammoths: The **Mammutheum** (*portmanteau of the German word for mammoth "Mammut" and "Museum"*)  with **Oscar being the main attraction**.

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/DSCF6702.JPG">

<br/>

Sadly, **this would be Bernard Raymond von Bredow's fall from grace**. Scientists (*outside of Russia*) no longer supported him due to the commercialization of their findings, he'd more and more deeply go into "experimental archeology" and begin believing in conspiratorial myths [losing all support from local politicians](https://www.samerbergernachrichten.de/224720-2/), *but not the local population entirely*. As has been said, his exhibits were widely visited, even the first one that was just Oscar in a gym hall in Siegsdorf in 1987 had [2000 visitors in just 2 weeks](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/planung-und-durchfuehrung-von-ausstellungen?showall=&limitstart=). 

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/oscar_in_voller_pracht.jpg">

The city of Siegsdorf, now being aware of the archeologic treasures surrounding it, began plotting against Bernard and opened their own museum named [*Southeast Bavarian Museum of Natural History and Mammoths*](https://museum-siegsdorf.de/museum.php) in May 1995 showcasing the **largest and best maintained skeleton of a mammoth ever discovered in Europe**, and it wasn't Oscar. The people of Siegsdorf creatively named it "Siegi". 

<br/>

Bernard was a local legend, and he wasn't willing to give up the fight. When the Internet came around he was willing to experiment with new ways of *marketing*. The exact moment when **it** happened aren't clear, but it must've been in the *earliest of days of the web*, as our historic WHOIS records can only trace it back until 2005. 

What had happened is that Bernard Raymond von Bredow registered two domains, both for his Mammutheum. One, quite obviously, *mammutheum.de*, and **the other named after the specific species of Oscar the Mammoth**. 

### Oscar the Mammoth was a Mastodon.

... this is when and why Bernard Raymond von Bredow first registered mastodon.de.

# The Mammutheum - 1991 to 2017

Honestly, I do not know what to write down here. We've already discussed so many things regarding Bernard Raymond von Bredow and his fascinating stories surrounding and cumulating in the Mammutheum I'd much rather want you to explore their website: https://www.mammutheum.de/ ([English/Any Language Version](https://www-mammutheum-de.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en))

Especially fascinating I find this interview he had with Bayern Alpha in 2004: [Bayern Alpha Interview](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/ueber-bernard-von-bredow/vortraege-und-hoerfunkbeitraege?showall=&start=1), as it is just Bernard answering so many questions about himself! 

Another interesting tidbit may be that Oscar the Mammoth was used as [promotional material for the Roland Emmerich movie 10.000 BC](https://www.mammutheum.de/index.php/museum-und-steinzeitpark/aktivitaeten-bis-heute?showall=&start=4) in 2008!

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/IMG_0185.JPG">

Yes, this is our Oscar the Mammoth being transported all the way to Berlin in order to be shown for the world premiere of 10.000 BC. 

There are terabytes of images on here and it tells a great story of what rich archeologic history such a small space had to offer, as well as how many visitors it must've fascinated in a year. I highly recommend you do this before continuing to the following, **rather morbid** sections. 

One way or the other, thanks to Bernard Raymond von Bredow, Oscar got his fair share on the big screen.

# Paraguay, a Murder, and a Domain long Forgotten - 2017 to 2021

**Side note**: To this very point, the domain mastodon.de has never been utilized and also will not be utilized for another 6 years. Not once. I mean you can [check the Internet Archive yourself](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/mastodon.de), there was a long time where the domain showed nothing and never a singular moment where any 404, access forbidden, or domain parking site revealed any information about its owner that isn't already revealed by WHOIS / BIND9 dig DNS lookups.

<br/>

The Mammutheum and Bernard Raymond von Bredow's archeologic interests have both kind of faded away by the year of 2017, which is why then and there Bernard and his then 10 year old daughter Loreena moved to Paraguay to begin a new chapter of their lives. It isn't known much about him during this time, but the Mammutheum continued running through family members and he sustained his living by building violins. 

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/bernard mit andrea amati 801x534.jpg">

Yes, he has been a skilled antique violin builder / refurbisher for about two decades at this point and *also has an interesting & long family history*, as you may have noticed, he is a man full of surprises and I am omitting ***so much*** information writing down this story as our main character in it is just too fascinating to condense into written, chronological words. Again: **look Bernard Raymond von Bredow up! Read more stuff about him** - I cannot possibly talk about all of it because this is already a huge article. 

<br/>

**Back to the story**: By October of 2021, precisely 46 years after first finding Oscar the Mammoth, Bernard Raymond von Bredow was 62 years and his daughter 14 years old. He was in [possession of four antique violins believed to have been made by the revered Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/stradivarius-violin-germans-killing-paraguay) which were worth [multiple millions of Euros](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/21/scientists-find-secret-behind-sweet-sound-of-stradivarius-violins). 

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blog/2023-09-05-history-of-domain-mastodon.de/stradivaris werkstatt 801x557.jpg">

Here is a report by a local TV station (*ABC TV Paraguay*) which shows the police investigation as it happened:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Detienen a un alemán por crimen en Areguá<br><br>"Allanamos tres casas de ciudadanos alemanes, conocidos del fallecido. Incautamos varios elementos", crio. Hugo Grance, Dpto. de Homicidios<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABCTVPy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ABCTVPy</a> 🔗<a href="https://t.co/ZvwJlbwdHn">https://t.co/ZvwJlbwdHn</a> <a href="https://t.co/7w2a3whped">pic.twitter.com/7w2a3whped</a></p>— ABC TV Paraguay (@ABCTVpy) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABCTVpy/status/1458420657948176390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br>

What precisely had happened and by whom is unknown to this day, yet this is the official story:

<br>

Bernard Raymond von Bredow and his 14 year old (*sometimes said to be 15 years old*) daughter Loreena (*sometimes called "Lydia" in news reports*) **were found murdered on the 22nd of October 2021 in their house in Patiño, Itauguá** in the South-West of Paraguay. The [crime report by Hugo Grance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/stradivarius-violin-germans-killing-paraguay), the chief investigator of the local police, notes that **Bredow's body showed signs of torture**. 

The main motive for this murder is believed to be the four four Stradivarius violins, built in the 16th/17th century, Bredow had posessed, worth multiple millions of Euros. After the murder they were no longer present in Bredow's home yet [found in the posession of **Volker Grannas**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/stradivarius-violin-germans-killing-paraguay), a 58 year-old German who not only lived near Bredow's residence, but also was a good friend of his. 

In the light of this murder, the following people were arrested:

- Volker Grannas, 58

- Yves Asriel Spartacus Steinmetz, 60

- Stephen Jorg Messing Dachinger, 51

Now, Volker Grannas claims the violins had been in his possession for a longer time as Bredow gave them into his custody when he travelled back to Germany for a summer, yet then lied to Bredow [claiming they were destroyed in a fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/stradivarius-violin-germans-killing-paraguay), when in reality as revealed through this investigation, they were in his possession the whole time. 

<br/>

So, why then kill a guy and his daughter when the theft had already been orchestrated? Well, you see, **these violins are worthless without the internationally recognized certification** of their authenticity, which is what Lorena Ledesma, the prosecutor for the Bredow Case, claims to have been the intention behind the murder. They also believed that this crime was [committed by someone who knew Bredow well](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/stradivarius-violin-germans-killing-paraguay) and that they have enough evidence to conclude that.

<br/>

The Bredow residence was left in such disarray and so full of blood stains that it became obvious both Bernard and Loreena von Bredow were murdered somewhere else on the property and then dragged into the positions they were found in.
